# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a modular chatbot system that demonstrates software engineering best practices. The system includes a RouterAgent that directs queries to specialized agents (KnowledgeAgent for RAG-based responses and MathAgent for mathematical calculations), with comprehensive security controls, structured observability, and modern infrastructure using Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to a chatbot that intelligently routes my queries to the right specialized agent, so that I receive accurate responses whether I'm asking about InfinitePay services or mathematical calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/chat` with message, user_id, and conversation_id THEN the system SHALL process the request and return a structured response
2. WHEN the RouterAgent receives a message THEN it SHALL decide between KnowledgeAgent or MathAgent based on message content
3. WHEN a mathematical expression is detected THEN the system SHALL route to MathAgent for processing
4. WHEN a knowledge query is detected THEN the system SHALL route to KnowledgeAgent for RAG-based response
5. WHEN the response is generated THEN the system SHALL return response, source_agent_response, and agent_workflow details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a React-based chat interface that supports multiple conversations, so that I can have organized conversations and see which agent handled each response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the front-end THEN the system SHALL display a simple chat interface
2. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL support multiple conversations via conversation_id
3. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN the system SHALL display full conversation history for each conversation_id
4. WHEN a response is received THEN the system SHALL show which agent was responsible for each response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the KnowledgeAgent to use RAG with InfinitePay help content, so that users receive accurate information about InfinitePay services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the KnowledgeAgent is initialized THEN it SHALL use content from https://ajuda.infinitepay.io/pt-BR/ as knowledge base
2. WHEN processing a knowledge query THEN the system SHALL use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar
3. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL log the source of the answer and execution time
4. WHEN answering queries like "What are the card machine fees?" THEN the system SHALL provide relevant InfinitePay information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the MathAgent to solve mathematical expressions using LLM interpretation, so that I can get accurate calculations for various mathematical problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MathAgent receives a mathematical query THEN it SHALL use an LLM to interpret and solve the expression
2. WHEN processing expressions like "How much is 65 x 3.11?" THEN the system SHALL return the correct calculation
3. WHEN handling expressions like "70 + 12" or "(42 * 2) / 6" THEN the system SHALL process and return accurate results
4. WHEN completing calculations THEN the system SHALL log execution time and processed content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want input sanitization and prompt injection prevention, so that the system is protected from malicious inputs and security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is received THEN the system SHALL sanitize input by removing malicious content like HTML and JavaScript
2. WHEN processing prompts THEN the system SHALL implement minimal defense mechanisms such as language validation
3. WHEN suspicious instructions are detected THEN the system SHALL block them to prevent prompt injection
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL never return raw exceptions to the client

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want structured logging with comprehensive observability data, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component processes a request THEN it SHALL generate structured JSON logs
2. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, level (INFO/DEBUG/ERROR), agent, conversation_id, user_id, and execution_time
3. WHEN the RouterAgent makes decisions THEN it SHALL log the decision and reasoning
4. WHEN agents process content THEN they SHALL log relevant processing details
5. WHEN using Redis THEN the system SHALL optionally use it for storing conversation history and simplified logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to run with Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure, so that it can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL provide Dockerfiles for front-end and back-end
2. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL provide docker-compose.yml for local execution with Redis
3. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide organized YAML files for Deployment, Service, and Ingress
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include configurations for front-end, back-end, and Redis components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit and integration tests, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing RouterAgent THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for routing decisions
2. WHEN testing MathAgent THEN the system SHALL include tests for simple mathematical expressions
3. WHEN testing the API THEN the system SHALL include end-to-end tests for the `/chat` endpoint
4. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL validate core functionality and error handling

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand, run, and contribute to the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN the README.md SHALL include instructions for running locally with Docker and docker-compose
2. WHEN deploying THEN the documentation SHALL explain how to run on Kubernetes with kubectl apply
3. WHEN understanding the system THEN the documentation SHALL describe the Router, Agents, Logs, and Redis architecture
4. WHEN testing THEN the documentation SHALL explain how to access the front-end, test multiple conversations, view example logs, understand security features, and run tests
